# rs-playground

## Welcome to My Rust Learning Journey!

`rs-playground` is where I store the code I'm writing while reading "The Rust Programming Language" book. This repository is a personal documentation of my learning process in Rust, showcasing the programs I've written as I progress through the book.

## Structure of the Repository

The codes are organized in the `/src/bin` directory. They are named in a sequential manner, indicating the order in which they were written. Each file follows the naming convention: `number_name.rs`. For example:

- `001_hello.rs`
- `002_guess.rs`
- ...and so on.

This structure helps in understanding the progression of topics and concepts I've encountered and learned in Rust.

## How to Run the Codes

The programs can be run using Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager. To run a specific program, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin file.rs
```

Just replace `file.rs` with the file you want to execute.

Certainly! Here's a revised version of the last part of your README:

## Purpose of This Repository

`rs-playground` is a reflection of my dedication to mastering Rust, captured through the code I write as I explore "The Rust Programming Language" book. It serves as a chronological showcase of my learning and skill development in Rust programming. This repository is intended as a personal documentation and a testament to my coding journey.

Feel free to explore the codes and witness the progression of my Rust journey. Each file in this repository marks a step forward in my understanding and application of Rust.
